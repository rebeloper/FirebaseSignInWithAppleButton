## üß≥ Features

Here's the list of the awesome features `FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton` has:
- [X] has all the functionality as the `SwiftUI` `SignInWithAppleButton`
- [X] after `Signing in with Apple` it will also authenticate with `Firebase Authentication`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to use

Using `FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton` is super simple:

```
FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton()
```

This will present a preset `SignInWithApple` button with all it's functionalities.

## ü§© Advanced usage

### Choose a `label` type. Default is `.signIn`:

```
FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton(label: .continue)
```

### Set up requested scopes . Default is `[.fullName, .email]`:

```
FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton(requestedScopes: [.email])
```

### Add a completion handler:

```
FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton() { (result) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let firebaseSignInWithAppleResult):
        print(firebaseSignInWithAppleResult)
        let uid = firebaseSignInWithAppleResult.authDataResult.user.uid
        let email = firebaseSignInWithAppleResult.authDataResult.user.email ?? ""
        let name = firebaseSignInWithAppleResult.token.name // name taken from Apple
        // this is a good place to save the user Profile to Firestore if it does not already exist
    case .failure(let err):
        print(err.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do save the `name` given by Apple on Firestore in a `Profile` because this will be given by Apple **ONLY** on the very first sign in!

## üé® Style

Style it as a regular `SwiftUI` `SignInWithAppleButton`:

```
FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton().signInWithAppleButtonStyle(.whiteOutline)
```

Add a frame to see the button visually change it's content:

```
FirebaseSignInWithAppleButton().frame(width: 100, height: 100)

// try:
// .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
// .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
// .frame(width: 200, height: 50)
// .frame(height: 150)
```
